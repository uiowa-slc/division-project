Division Project Shortcodes
===========================

There are a few shortcodes that come standard with the division project. You can place them in any content field that has formatting (bold, italics, links, etc).

Flickr
------
Basic Usage:
* **[flickr set="xxxxxxx" /]**
* **[flickr photo="xxxxxx" /]**

### Sets
You can show sets on a page a few different ways as long as the set is publically viewable:

#### Galleries (default)
Galleries just lay out all of the photos (in a set) on the page in a one or multi column layout.
* **[flickr set="xxxxxxx" /]** - Displays a Flickr set in a single column gallery.
* **[flickr set="xxxxxxx" columns="2" /]** - Displays a Flickr set in a two column gallery.

#### Slideshows
Slideshows or sliders show the photos in one, single block, moving left or right.
* **[flickr set="xxxxxxx" type="slideshow" /]** - Displays a Flickr set in a single column

### Single Photos
* **[flickr photo="xxxxxx" /]**
